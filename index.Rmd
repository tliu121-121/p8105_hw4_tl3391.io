PROJECT EXPERIENCE	
Heart Disease Dataset Analysis and Visualization      	Jul.2023-Sep.2023
Leader | Advisor: Xiner Zhou, instructor, University of California, Davis
	Utilized R for coding and data analysis, demonstrating expertise in data wrangling, model selection, justification, and data visualization
	Analyzed the Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset to identify the main factors associated with heart disease
	Managed different types of data within the dataset, including numerical and categorical data
	Employed ANOVA techniques to the dataset's diverse data types to construct relationships between various factors
	Identified the maximum heart rate achieved as highly correlated with the presence of heart disease by analyzing correlations between different factors and the outcome
	Implemented boosting models and assessed their accuracy in comparison to other models to determine the number of major vessels as the most influential factor
Mathematical algorithm design	Dec.2022-Mar.2023
Leader | Advisor: Stephen Schonsheck, Assistant Professor, University of California, Davis
	Designed and implemented a suite of numerical algorithms in Python, demonstrating the application of various mathematical methods to solve complex problems
	Devised a root-finding algorithm using the bisection method; evaluated performance through error and iteration tracking, and represented results with log-log plots for improved data analysis
	Employed Gaussian elimination, LU factorization, Jacobi Method, and Gauss-Siedel method for solving single matrices; compiled average computation time and residual error data into comprehensive reports
	Utilized the power method for solving large matrices, specifically focusing on eigenvalue computation
	Implemented Newton's method for solving nonlinear equations, providing an efficient solution for complex mathematical problems
	Applied the steepest descent technique to nonlinear problem-solving scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of optimization methods in real-world applications
Churn Prediction in Telecommunications                   	Jun.2022-Aug.2022
Leader 
	Explored algorithms for churn prediction in the telecommunications industry.
	Proficient in data processing, supervised machine learning model training, and model performance evaluation.
	Mastered data preprocessing techniques to prepare data for analysis.
	Successfully trained machine learning models to make predictions and Analyzed feature importance to identify the main factors influencing the results.
Implementation of the Genetic Algorithm with Entropy-Boltzmann Selection Method      	Mar.2022-Jul.2022
Leader | Advisor: Rishidev Chaudhuri, Assistant Professor, University of California, Davis
	Implemented a genetic algorithm in Python to solve the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), optimizing the route for a salesman to visit a set of cities exactly once while minimizing the total distance traveled
	Utilized Boltzmann selection, an entropy-related scoring method, to improve the genetic algorithm's performance and alleviate issues such as premature convergence during the later stages of evolution
	Addressed the challenge of long runtime by optimizing parameters like population size and mutation probability, acknowledging the trade-off between convergence and divergence in the algorithm based on these parameters
	Identified the importance of parameter optimization and emphasized the significance of striking a balance between population size and mutation rate to avoid convergence issues or diverging into a random search
